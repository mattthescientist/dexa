The Differential EXAFS Analyser (DEXA)
--------------------------------------

The source code is best compiled with GNU make. Please read the notes at the top
of Makefile for further instructions. Documentation is found in the docs folder 
in DVI and PDF format, with the original LaTeX source file also available.

Before compiling, check you have:

 GNU Scientific Library (GSL) (absolutely required)
 Minuit library               (for the Minuit version of DEXA)
 GNU make
 GNU g++                      (or equivalent C++ compiler)
 
If everything is installed to default system locations, just type 'make'...
