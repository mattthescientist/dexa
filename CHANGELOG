Version 1.0.1:
* Fixed low-k sample rate in Resample.cpp, resample().
* Improved handling of paths.dat header such that it can tell the difference 
  between files from FEFF6 or FEFF8.
* Added pseudo copy constructor to MgstSpectrum to remove multiple loading of
  experimental spectra when using more than one sub-structure.
* Fixed resampling problem in DiffXasSpectrum::loadSigmaSqr().
* Reduced MAX_RADIUS to 20. It was previously 40.
* Fixed termination condition in DEXA Minuit so that fit minima are correctly
  identified. Achieved by adding setErrorDef(1.0) to startfit().
* Reduced Minuit fitting strategy from 2 to 0. Extra precision provided by the 
  higher level was only fitting noise.
* Fixed #define MF_MGST_FCN_H in MgstFcnMinuit.h. There was a typo.
* Fixed low-k sample rate in Resample.cpp, processNoise().
* Fixed truction of sigma^2 in DiffXasSpectrum::setFilter().
* Added verbose command line option to control the output level.
* Added better help on the command line
* Added output of version number at start of program execution.
* Modified Makefile so that only DEXA Minuit is compiled by default.
* Modified binary filenames in Makefile. DexaMinuit is now dexa and DexaGsl is
  now dexa_gsl.
* General code cleanups and additional commenting.

Version 1.0:
* First release
